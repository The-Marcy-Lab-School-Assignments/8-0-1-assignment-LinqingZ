# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Middleware functions are used to handle and process requests before they reach the final route handler or controller. They can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.
Normal controllers are responsible for handling the final processing of a request and generating a response. They contain the business logic for specific routes.
